TROUBLESHOOTING:

* I get no leds at all 
        - check power.

* X2LEDB does not light up.
        - check network connection. 
        - If there is no DHCP server on network then it may take up 
          to a minute to obtain an IP address

* X2LEDB lights up but my web browser cannot load http://xc2.local
        - Linux: try installing either avahi or libhowl for mdns name
        lookup
        - Windows: try installing Bonjour for Windows available from
        Apple
        - You can start the device up to a static IP address by
          holding down button A - this defaults to 192.168.0.100. 
          Configure your PC to be able to connect to this address and
          got to http://192.168.0.100. In the configuration screen
          you can change the static ip and change the default boot
          method to go to static ip without holding button A down.

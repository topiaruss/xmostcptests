This application contains the implementation of the demo webserver on
the XC-2.

The web server demonstrates the abilities of the XS1-G4 chip to
implement a combination of hardware and software tasks all written in software.

  * The hardware part is an ethernet MAC and MII
    interface which talks to the ethernet phy. 
  * The MAC connects to a protocol stack which then connects
    to a webserver serving pages from onboard memory.
  * There is some persisent configuration state to the
    server (IP address configuration) which survives if the device 
    is turned on and off. This state is stored in flash memory for
    which the hardware interface is again implemented on the chip in software.

The protocol stack is implemented with a port of the uIP TCP/IP
stack. It implements the following protocols:

  * Ethernet L2 Transport
  * IP
  * ICMP
  * IGMP
  * DHCP
  * IPv4LL Auto-IP allocation
  * Netbios naming service
  * MDNS (partial)
  * UDP
  * TCP/IP
  * HTTP

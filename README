This is a very experimental project for the XMOS XC-2 - my version is 2V0

I'm trying to attain a high send speed for a connection initiated by the XC-2
to a server. I'm currently at the point where I can send up to about 50
messages without incident, then something blocks. And if I remove my debug
prints, I can't even send the first packet.

I'm finding the documentation a bit thin (basically it's a header file, a few
post of non-functional code on the forum, and what you can extract from the
firmware sources.

I'd love to have a dialog with anyone who has managed significant send
performance on the XC-2.

To run it, pull in the entire repos as a new workspace.
Then you need to configure a tcpip server with 192.168.2.166, and run
the python dummy_server supplied in the root of the repos. The server listens
on port 8008, and prints incoming packets.

On my MacBook, I connect to the web via Wifi, and manually configure ethernet, 
after plugging in the XC-2, to 192.168.2.166.  This keeps me connected for
research, while the python server run at the terminal prints the traffic.

Pull requests accepted.
